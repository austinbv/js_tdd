Code in the `bag` directory shows a simple test drive of the Bag data structure. Simply put, a bag is an unordered unique set.

If you would like to look at the steps to drive out the Bag take a look at the git history. Each commit to bag was prefixed with "PASSING" or "FAILING" to reflect the tests state that that point.
